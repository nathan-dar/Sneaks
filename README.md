# Sneaks - CPSC 210 Project

## An Overview
Sneaks is an app designed to make keeping track of your sneakers easy and simple. The app will be able to keep track of your
collection of sneakers complete with each sneaker's Retail Value, Resell Value, Size, Brand, Colourway, and Condition. 

**Why I Chose  This Project:**
- I've been an avid sneaker collector for years, and I wanted my project to reflect some of my interests which include 
streetwear and computer science!
- This sneaker collection tracker app is a perfect, simple-enough project which fits within my desired scope of difficulty

## User Stories
My main tasks for **Phase  1** of the project:
- As a user, I want to be able to add a sneaker from my collection
- As a user, I want to be able to remove a sneaker from my collection
- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of sneakers in my collection
- As a user, I want to be able to view the retail and re-sell value of my collection
