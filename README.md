# Sneaks - CPSC 210 Project

## An Overview
Sneaks is an app designed to make keeping track of your sneakers easy and simple. The app will be able to keep track of 
your collection of sneakers complete with each sneaker's Brand, Model, Colourway, Size, Condition, Retail Value, and 
Resell Value. Currently there are four main features including: adding sneakers, removing sneakers, a breakdown of your
collection statistics, and a viewing of the sneakers in your collection.

**Why I Chose  This Project:**
- I've been an avid sneaker collector for years, and I wanted my project to reflect some of my interests which include 
streetwear and computer science!
- This sneaker collection tracker app is a perfect, simple-enough project which fits within my desired scope of difficulty
- I also wanted to choose a project that had the potential to actually be used in my daily life

## User Stories
My main tasks for **Phase  1** of the project:

- As a user, I want to be able to remove a sneaker from my collection
